# integral calculator attempt - success with gpt.

# calculate e^3 * sine^2(6.9x)

# from an integration from 0 to 1

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import quad

a = -5  # Lower bound
b = 0  # Upper bound

def f(x):
    return np.exp(3) * np.sin(6.9 * x)**2 

# my function to integrate

answer, _ = quad(f, a, b)

print(answer)

# '_' is to remove the error estimation of my answer.

# we don't need, just the fuckn answer lol.
